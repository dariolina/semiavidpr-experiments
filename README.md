# Experiments for "Information Dispersal with Provable Retrievability for Rollups"

To get started, see `run-experiments.sh` and `format-results.sh` (exploratory experiments), `run-experiments2.sh` and `format-results2.sh` (Figures 6, 9, 10, 11 in the manuscript, see below), `run-experiments3.sh` and `format-results3.sh` (Figure 7 in the manuscript), as well as `related-work.jl` (Table 1, Figure 8 in the manuscript).

Implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [arkworks](https://arkworks.rs/) libraries.
